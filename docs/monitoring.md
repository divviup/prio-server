# Metrics, graphs and alerting

We deploy Prometheus and Grafana into Prio clusters. We gather metrics from a few sources:

 - host level metrics via [`prometheus-node-exporter`](https://prometheus.io/docs/guides/node-exporter/)
 - Kubernetes metrics via [`prometheus-kube-state-metrics`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics)
 - [GCP Cloud Monitoring](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring) via [`stackdriver-exporter`](https://github.com/prometheus-community/stackdriver_exporter)
 - `workflow-manager` pushes metrics via [`prometheus-pushgateway`](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/pushing/)
 - `facilitator` serves metrics from a `/metrics` endpoint on a configurable port.

## Dealing with alerts

The `prod-us` and `staging` environments are configured to deliver alerts to VictorOps. By default, other environments will track alerts in `prometheus-alertmanager`, but no alerts will be forwarded to VictorOps. Regardless of environment, alerts are tracked by `prometheus-alertmanager`.

To silence alerts, use the `prometheus-alertmanager` web interface. See [below](#access-prometheus-and-grafana-ui) for guidance on accessing the web interfaces, and [Prometheus documentation](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/alertmanager/) for more on Alertmanager silences.

### Dead letter queue alerts

We alert if there are undelivered messages in any dead letter queue for five minutes, meaning that some message has repeatedly failed to be handled by a worker. You can examine the undeliverable messages by examining the relevant dead letter subscription (see the `subscription_id` label in the firing alert) [in the GCP PubSub console](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudpubsub/subscription/list), and you can dismiss the alert by acking the undeliverable messages in the subscription.

## Storage

We configure a regional Google Compute Engine disk for `prometheus-server`'s storage. Its size is configurable in the an environment's `tfvars` file. the GCE disk is made available to `prometheus-server` as a Kubernetes persistent volume claim.

## Configuration

Most configuration is handled via Terraform, in the `monitoring` module. Individual environment configuration will typically set the `victorops_routing_key` variable to an appropriate value (e.g. a preconfigured routing key in Splunk for production/staging environments, most likely a bogus value for development environments) in the environment's `tfvars` file.

Monitoring can be disabled by setting the `pushgateway` variable to the empty string.

### Alerting rules

Alerting rules are defined in `modules/monitoring/prometheus_alerting_rules.yml`. When writing alerting rules, note carefully the difference between Terraform template variables (e.g., `${environment}`), which are substituted by Terraform during `apply`, and Prometheus template variables (e.g., `{{ $labels.kubernetes_name }}`), which are rendered by Prometheus when an alert fires.

### Alertmanager

`prometheus-alertmanager` is configured to send alerts to VictorOps. If an environment's alerts should generate VictorOps pages, then the `victorops_routing_key` variable in the environment's `tfvars` should be set to an existing routing key in VictorOps. If no valid routing key is provided, then alerts will still be tracked in `prometheus-alertmanager` and visible in its GUI, but nothing will page.

`alertmanager`'s configuration is stored in the Kubernetes secret `prometheus-alertmanager-config` in the `monitoring` namespace. That config document contains the VictorOps API key, which we do not check into source control (see [below](#hooking-up-victoropssplunk-oncall-alerts) for details on providing the API key). Because Terraform is configured to ignore changes to the contents of the secret, if you make changes to `alertmanager` configuration via Terraform, you will either need to apply those changes to the Kubernetes secret manually, or you will need to delete the secret `monitoring/prometheus-alertmanager-config` so that Terraform can re-create the secret from scratch.

### Stackdriver exporter

`stackdriver-exporter` is configured with an allow-list of GCP Cloud Monitoring/Stackdriver metric name prefixes to be exported to Prometheus. You can export additional Stackdriver metrics by [looking up the prefix(es)](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/metrics_gcp) and appending to the `stackdriver.metrics.typePrefixes` list in `resource.helm_release.stackdriver_exporter` in `monitoring.tf`.

### Ad-hoc configuration changes

For development or incident response purposes, you might want to make rapid changes to `prometheus` configuration without going through Terraform.

If you want to modify `prometheus-server` config or alert definitions, you can modify the relevant key in the `prometheus-server` ConfigMap in the `monitoring` namespace. The various Prometheus components will detect your changes and automatically reload configuration.

If you want to modify `stackdriver-exporter` configuration, you can edit the `stackdriver-exporter-prometheus-stackdriver-exporter` deployment in the `monitoring` namespace as its configuration is provided in environment variables in the container spec.

## Accessing Prometheus and Grafana UI

None of Grafana, Prometheus or any of Prometheus' components are exposed publicly. You can access them using `kubectl port-forward` to make a port on remote pod's network accessible locally. So, to make Prometheus' `server` component reachable at `localhost:8080`, you would do:

    kubectl -n monitoring port-forward $(kubectl -n monitoring get pod --selector="app=prometheus,component=server,release=prometheus" --output jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') 8080:9090

For `prometheus-alertmanager`:

    kubectl -n monitoring port-forward $(kubectl -n monitoring get pod --selector="app=prometheus,component=alertmanager,release=prometheus" --output jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') 8081:9093

And for Grafana:

    kubectl -n monitoring port-forward $(kubectl -n monitoring get pod --selector="app.kubernetes.io/instance=grafana,app.kubernetes.io/name=grafana" --output jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') 8082:3000

To access other components, look up the labels on the pod for the component you want to reach to construct an appropriate `--selector` argument, and check the running container's configuration to see what port(s) it listens on. Naturally, this requires you to have valid Kubernetes cluster credentials in place for use with `kubectl`.

Grafana requires authentication. You can login as the `admin` user, whose password is in a Kubernetes secret. Run `kubectl -n monitoring get secret grafana -o=yaml`, then base64 decode the value for `admin-password` and use it to authenticate.

## Hooking up VictorOps/Splunk Oncall alerts

Sending alerts from Prometheus Alertmanager to VictorOps requires an API key, which we do not want to store in source control, and so you must update a Kubernetes secret. First, get the API key from the [VictorOps portal](https://portal.victorops.com) (configuring VictorOps teams, rotations, and escalation policies is out of scope for this document). Then, get the existing `prometheus-alertmanager` config out of the Kubernetes secret:

    kubectl -n monitoring get secrets  prometheus-alertmanager-config -o jsonpath="{.data.alertmanager\.yml}" | base64 -d > /path/to/config/file.yml

Update the `api_key` value in the `victorops_config` and `apply` the secret back into place. There's no straightforward way to update a secret value using kubectl, so we use [this trick](https://blog.atomist.com/updating-a-kubernetes-secret-or-configmap/):

    kubectl -n monitoring create secret generic prometheus-alertmanager-config --from-file=alertmanager.yml=/path/to/config/file.yml --dry-run=client -o=json | kubectl apply -f -

For more details, see the [VictorOps docs on Prometheus integration](https://help.victorops.com/knowledge-base/victorops-prometheus-integration/).

## Configuring Kubernetes dashboard in Grafana

No dashboards are automatically configured in Grafana. To get [a dashboard with an overview of Kubernetes status](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/315):

* Log into Grafana (see "Accessing Prometheus and Grafana", above)
* Go to Dashboards -> Manage
* Hit "Import"
* Enter "315" into the "Import via grafana.com" box (or the ID of whatever dashboard you wish to configure)
* Select the "prometheus" data source
* Enjoy the graphs'n'gauges
