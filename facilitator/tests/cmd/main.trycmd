USAGE:
    facilitator [OPTIONS] [SUBCOMMAND]

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information

OPTIONS:
        --force-json-log-output <BOOL>    Force log output to JSON format [env: FORCE_JSON_LOG_OUTPUT=]  [default:
                                          false]  [possible values: true, false]

SUBCOMMANDS:
    aggregate                           Verify peer validation share and emit sum part.
                                        
                                        Storage arguments: Any flag ending in -input or -output can take an S3
                                        bucket (s3://<region>/<bucket>), a Google Storage bucket (gs://), or a local
                                        directory name. The corresponding -identity flag specifies what identity to
                                        use with a bucket.
                                        
                                                For S3 buckets: An identity flag may contain an AWS IAM role,
                                        specified using an ARN (i.e. "arn:..."). Facilitator will assume that role
                                        using an OIDC auth token obtained from the GKE metadata service. Appropriate
                                        mappings need to be in place from Facilitator's k8s service account to its
                                        GCP service account to the IAM role. If the identity flag is omitted or is
                                        the empty string, use credentials from ~/.aws.
                                        
                                                For GS buckets: An identity flag may contain a GCP service account
                                        (identified by an email address). Requests to Google Storage (gs://) are

                                        an identity flag is set, facilitator will use its default service account to
                                        impersonate a different account, which should have permissions to write to
                                        or read from the named bucket. If an identity flag is omitted or is the
                                        empty string, the default service account exposed by the GKE metadata
                                        service is used. Keys: All keys are P-256. Public keys are base64-encoded
                                        DER SPKI. Private keys are in the base64 encoded format expected by libprio-
